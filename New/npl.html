    <p>Nepal,[a] officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[b] is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is
        mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet
        Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated
        from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse
        geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains,
        including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and the largest city.
        Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official
        language.</p>
